Security-first IT for Savannah's creative community.

Savannah Creative Cyber is a client-facing campaign by Low Country Cyber Solutions LLC.

I protect the work of local studios, artists, designers, and creators with affordable, open-source security that stays out of your way.

## Who I Help
- Design and branding studios
- Recording studios and music producers
- Photographers, videographers, content creators
- Small agencies and creative collectives

## What I Offer
- **Creative Studio Security & Backup Checkup** (one-time, fixed price)
- **Managed Open-Source Monitoring** (monthly)
- **Secure Remote Collaboration & Network Design** (project)
- **Extra hands for the IT odds and ends that keep you moving** (scoped)

## How I Work
- Security-first, creativity-friendly
- Clear scope, timeline, price
- Predictable service windows; no surprise 2 a.m. emergencies
- Remote-first; onsite only when truly needed
- Evidence-based recommendations, no fear sales

## For Savannah Creatives: What I Actually Do
If you make art and rely on your computers, I help you avoid:
- Losing work if a laptop dies or gets stolen
- Ransomware wiping out your catalog
- Exposed remote access or open Wi-Fi letting strangers in
- Scattered files and untested backups

### What you get in a Checkup (fixed price)
- A map of where your projects live (machines, drives, cloud) and how they move
- A sanity check on backups (aiming for 3-2-1) and a simple, tested restore path
- A quick lock-down of easy attack paths (RDP/VPN, Wi-Fi, passwords/MFA, updates)
- A short, plain-English report with the 5–10 most important fixes, prioritized

### How it works (no pressure)
1. Email me at creative-security.falcon317@passinbox.com with "Checkup" in the subject.
2. We do a quick discovery (20–30 min call or email Q&A).
3. I deliver the Checkup and, if you want, implement the top fixes.

### Pricing
- Checkup: starting at $350 (intro $300 for first 3 clients)
- Ongoing monitoring: starting at $250/month (sized for small studios)
- Projects (network/remote access): starting at $800 (single studio setup)
